# Discover Python with Callysto

This notebooks is inspired by the "Hour of Code" programs where students are introduced to computer science through a 1-hour in-class workshop. 

Students can navigate this notebook using the "slideshow" mode to get a basic introduction to Jupyter, Callysto, and Python. Students will explore the basics of coding with Python and build towards creating number sequences such as the Fibonacci sequence. Each learning point is small and concise, and followed by an opportunity experiment. This can be a self-paced lesson, although instructors may also take a follow-along/guided approach as well.

Neither students nor teachers are expected to have significant experience with the platform, although it does greatly help to have guided instruction and support.

This proposed program is inspired from our “Python Discoverers” program, combined with our volunteer work for the “Hour of Code” movement. Through a series of hour-long, guided, introductory lessons, we will use Callysto and Jupyter Notebooks to teach computational thinking through the focused and isolated introduction of Python. Kids will have an enhanced learning experience that is focused on the code and projects provided, without the overhead and distraction of “traditional” programming environments.

A critical success factor to this initiative is the development of a series of Jupyter templates on the Callysto platform to deliver 8 notebooks designed to support the following hour-long lessons:

•	Lessons 1-2: Introduction to Callysto, Python, basic operations and control flows.
•	Lessons 3-4: Introduction to variables, loops, debugging, and a Caesar cypher project.
•	Lessons 5-7: Introduction to graphics with the Turtle module to create graphical projects such mandala drawings.
•	Lesson 8: Putting it all together and using Python to program a micro controller (micro:bit) and create an interactive name tag, emoticons, or a reaction game.
